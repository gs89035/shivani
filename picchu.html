<h2> Name and Orthography </h2>
<hr>
For most speakers of English or Spanish, the first 'c' in Picchu is silent. 

Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472). Often mistakenly referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is the most familiar icon of Inca civilization. The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later at the time of the Spanish conquest. Although known locally, it was not known to the Spanish during the colonial period and remained unknown to the outside world until American historian Hiram Bingham brought it to international attention in 1911.

Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary structures are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows. Most of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
 By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues.
Historians believe Machu Picchu was built at the height of the Inca Empire, which dominated western South America in the 15th and 16th centuries. It was abandoned an estimated 100 years after its construction, probably around the time the Spanish began their conquest of the mighty pre-Columbian civilization in the 1530s. There is no evidence that the conquistadors ever attacked or even reached the mountaintop citadel, however; for this reason, some have suggested that the residents’ desertion occurred because of a smallpox epidemic.
In the summer of 1911 the American archaeologist Hiram Bingham arrived in Peru with a small team of explorers hoping to find Vilcabamba, the last Inca stronghold to fall to the Spanish. Traveling on foot and by mule, Bingham and his team made their way from Cuzco into the Urubamba Valley, where a local farmer told them of some ruins located at the top of a nearby mountain. The farmer called the mountain Machu Picchu, which translates to “old peak” in the native Quechua language. On July 24, after a tough climb to the mountain’s ridge in cold and drizzly weather, Bingham met a small group of peasants who showed him the rest of the way. Led by an 11-year-old boy, Bingham got his first glimpse of the intricate network of stone terraces marking the entrance to Machu Picchu.

<h2> History of Machu picchu </h2>
<hr>
Machu Picchu is believed (by Richard L. Burger) to have been built in the 1450s.[18] Construction appears to date from two great Inca rulers, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui (1438–1471) and Túpac Inca Yupanqui (1472–1493). 
There is a consensus among archaeologists that Pachacutec ordered the construction of the royal estate for himself, most likely after a successful military campaign. Though Machu Picchu is considered to be a "royal" estate, surprisingly, it would not have been passed down in the line of succession. Rather it was used for 80 years before being abandoned, seemingly because of the Spanish Conquests in other parts of the Inca Empire.
 It is possible that most of its inhabitants died from smallpox introduced by travelers before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the area.
Most modern archaeologists and historians agree that Machu Picchu was built by the Inca Pachacutec, the greatest statesman of Tahuantinsuyo (what the Inca called their expansive empire), who ruled from 1438 to 1471. Archaeologists assume – given radiocarbon evidence – that the construction of Machu Picchu dates back to approximately the 15th century.

The construction of Machu Picchu began around the time the Inca began to expand their territory across the continent. According to archaeologists, a battle was fought and won against the Chanca people, thus giving power to Inca Pachacutec and solidifying his victorious reign over more lands.

Inca Pachacutec was the first to emerge beyond the valley of Cusco after his epic victory over the Chancas.  A strong Inca leader, he was known for his territorial conquests and the development of religion and spirituality. Being recognized as the “constructor” of Cusco is among Pachacutec’s  greatest achievements.
The origin of Machu Picchu is attributed with some certainty to Pachacutec. Likely built as a refuge for elite members of Inca aristocracy, the fortress was constructed on the eastern slopes of the Vilcanota mountain range, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) from Cusco, the capital of the empire.
Occupied by at least three generations of Incas, Machu Picchu was abandoned in a sudden and mysterious decision. The strongest hypothesis explains that since lower class citizens didn’t know the existence of Machu Picchu and routes leading there were prohibited for anyone who was not part of the small circle of elite Inca, that knowledge of the grand city simple faded from historical memory over the years.

<h2> Construction of Machu Picchu </h2>
<hr>
The Inca city of Machu Picchu is, without a doubt, a true work of architecture and engineering. Despite having few tools, thanks to their knowledge, the Incas managed to create hundreds of terraces that held up the walls of granite, a particularly hard material. Thanks to their drainage system, these walls remain solid long after their construction.
A geo-archaeological analysis by Rualdo Menegat of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) has determined that the Incas built Machu Picchu on a network of tectonic faults intentionally. The fracture predisposed the rocks to break along the planes, which reduced the energy needed to carve them. On the other hand, the fractures predisposed the meltwater and rainwater to be channeled directly to the place where it is located. This spot also avoided the risk of avalanche and served as a defense against the Chanca culture, which was warlike. 
Despite what we have thought for so long, the strategy of the Incas has allowed its conservation during the five centuries it has been in existence. A testament of incredible techniques that put in relevance the advanced knowledge of this civilization.

. The rediscovery of Machu Picchu
The “rediscovery” of the so-called “lost city” of Machu Picchu was assigned in 1911 to the American Hiram Bingham. Although it is said that Machu Picchu was never “rediscovered” because the locals knew of its existence, this is the most told story of how he made the importance of this place known.
The explorer and archaeologist left Cuzco with the aim of finding the Inca city of Vilcabamba, which had succumbed to Spanish invaders in 1572. Following the Urubamba River, he reached a mountain where he found the white granite ruins hidden among the vegetation. Although at that time he thought he had found Vilcabamba, the Inca city located between two mountains was the city that was named after one of them: Machu Picchu.
Bingham was impressed by this marvel, so he managed to start a scientific study supported by Yale University, the National Geographic Society, as well as the support of the Peruvian Government until 1915.

<h2> Economy </h2>
<hr>
The Incas had a centrally planned economy, perhaps the most successful ever seen. Its success was in the efficient management of labor and the administration of resources they collected as tribute. Collective labor was the base for economic productivity and for the creation of social wealth in the Inca society. By working together people in the ayllu (the center of economic productivity) created such wealth that the Spanish were astonished with what they encountered. Every citizen was required to contribute with his labor and refusal or laziness was punishable with the death penalty. Labor was divided according to region, agriculture would be centralized in the most productive regions, ceramic production, road building, textile and other skills according to ayllus. The government collected all the surplus after local needs were met and distributed it where it was needed. In exchange for their work citizens had free clothing, food, health care and education.
The use of the land was a right that individuals had as members of the ayllu.
 The curaca, as the representative of the ayllu, redistributed the land to each member according to the size of their families. The dimensions of the land varied according to its agricultural quality and it was measured in tupus, a local measurement unit. A married couple would get one and a half tupus, for each male child the couple received one tupu and for each female half a tupu. When the son or daughter started their own family each additional tupu was taken away and given to the new family. Each family worked their land but they did not own it, the Inca estate was the rightful owner. The land was used to provide subsistence food for the family.

<h2> Location </h2>
<hr>
The location of Machu Picchu is 70 mi (112.5 km) northeast of the city of Cusco, at 7,890 ft (2,400 m) above sea level, within the Machu Picchu Archaeological Park, which comprises a large area of the province of Urubamba in the Cusco Department. It is surrounded by a huge forest of majestic mountains.
The surface of the Archaeological Park, including the urban and agricultural areas, covers a total of 32,592 hectares. It is located on the eastern slopes of the Cordillera de Vilcabamba mountain range bordering the rivers Apurimac and Urubamba.

It is located at 13 ° 9 ’47 “South latitude and 72 ° 32' 44” W, in the province of Urubamba. The nearest major city is Cusco.

The Inca archaeological site is located halfway between the tops of two mountains, Machu Picchu Mountain and Huayna Picchu, about 490 yards (450 meters) above the valley floor. At the bottom of the hills is the Vilcanota-Urubamba River.

Machu Picchu Montana and Huayna Picchu are part of a larger formation known as orographic Vilcabamba Batholith, in the Central Cordillera of the Peruvian Andes. They are located on the left bank of the Urubamba Canyon, formerly known as Quebrada de Picchu. The biogeographical classification of this region is the Peruvian Yungas ecoregion.

<h2>Interesting facts about Machu Picchu </h2>
<hr>
1. In the Quechua Indian language, “Machu Picchu” means “Old Peak” or “Old Mountain.”

 2. Machu Picchu is made up of more than 150 buildings ranging from baths and houses to temples and sanctuaries.

3. The compound contains more than 100 separate flights of stairs. Most of the individual staircases were carved from one slab of stone.

4. Although many of the stones that were used to build the city were more than 50 pounds, it is believed that no wheels were used to transport these rocks up the mountain. Rather, it is thought that hundreds of men pushed the heavy rocks up the steep mountain side.

5.Many different theories exist about Machu Picchu’s purpose—a royal estate and a secret ceremonial center among them.

6.The Incas were some of the best masons in the world. The structures were so well built with a technique called ashlar (stones that are cut to fit together without mortar) that not even a knife blade can fit in between stones.
7. Machu Picchu was only known locally until Yale Professor Hiram Bingham re-discovered the site in 1911. His book, The Lost City of the Incas, was based on his findings.

8.A long-standing dispute between Peru and Yale University has existed over the artifacts collected by Bingham during his exploration of the site. Yale maintains that they own the items while Peru insists they were given on loan.

9. Machu Picchu was an astronomical observatory, and its sacred Intihuatana stone accurately indicates the two equinoxes. Twice a year, the sun sits directly over the stone creating no shadow.

10. Unfortunately, most cities built by the Inca civilization were destroyed by the Spanish conquest. Machu Picchu was in a hidden location—invisible from below—and not found, making it one of the most well-preserved Inca cities and an archeological gem.

<h2> More about Machu Picchu </h2>
<hr>
Machu Picchu lies in the southern hemisphere, 13.164 degrees south of the equator. It is 80 kilometres (50 miles) northwest of Cusco, on the crest of the mountain Machu Picchu, located about 2,430 metres (7,970 feet) above mean sea level, over 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) lower than Cusco, which has an elevation of 3,400 metres (11,200 ft).As such, it had a milder climate than the Inca capital. It is one of the most important archaeological sites in South America, one of the most visited tourist attractions in Latin America and the most visited in Peru.

Machu Picchu features wet humid summers and dry frosty winters, with the majority of the annual rain falling from October through to March.

Machu Picchu is situated above a bow of the Urubamba River, which surrounds the site on three sides, where cliffs drop vertically for 450 metres (1,480 ft) to the river at their base. The area is subject to morning mists rising from the river. The location of the city was a military secret, and its deep precipices and steep mountains provided natural defenses. The Inca Bridge, an Inca grass rope bridge, across the Urubamba River in the Pongo de Mainique, provided a secret entrance for the Inca army. Another Inca bridge was built to the west of Machu Picchu, the tree-trunk bridge, at a location where a gap occurs in the cliff that measures 6 metres (20 ft).

The city sits in a saddle between the two mountains Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu,[30] with a commanding view down two valleys and a nearly impassable mountain at its back. It has a water supply from springs that cannot be blocked easily. The hillsides leading to it were terraced, to provide more farmland to grow crops and to steepen the slopes that invaders would have to ascend. The terraces reduced soil erosion and protected against landslides. Two high-altitude routes from Machu Picchu cross the mountains back to Cusco, one through the Sun Gate, and the other across the Inca bridge. Both could be blocked easily, should invaders approach along them.

Machu Picchu and other sites in the area are built over earthquake faults. This may not be a coincidence, according to 2019 research: "One simple answer, researchers now suggest, is that that’s where building materials for the site — large amounts of already fractured rock — were readily available."
