<h2> Name and Orthography </h2>
<hr>
Christ the Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese, is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by Polish-French sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida fashioned the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide.
The statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long, 700 short tons), and is located at the peak of the 700-metre (2,300 ft) Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca Forest National Park overlooking the city of Rio de Janeiro. A symbol of Christianity across the world, the statue has also become a cultural icon of both Rio de Janeiro and Brazil, and is listed as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.
Christ the Redeemer, Portuguese Cristo Redentor, colossal statue of Jesus Christ at the summit of Mount Corcovado, Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil. Celebrated in traditional and popular songs, Corcovado towers over Rio de Janeiro, Brazil’s principal port city. The statue of Christ the Redeemer was completed in 1931 and stands 98 feet (30 metres) tall, its horizontally outstretched arms spanning 92 feet (28 metres). The statue has become emblematic of both the city of Rio de Janeiro and the whole nation of Brazil.

<h2> History </h2>
<hr>
Priest Pedro Maria Boss first suggested placing a Christian monument on Mount Corcovado in the mid 1850s to honor Princess Isabel, regent of Brazil and the daughter of Emperor Pedro II, but the project was not approved. In 1889, the country became a republic, and due to the separation of church and state, the proposed statue was dismissed.
The Catholic Circle[clarification needed] of Rio made a second proposal for a landmark statue on the mountain in 1920. The group organized an event called Semana do Monumento ("Monument Week") to attract donations and collect signatures to support the building of the statue. The organization was motivated by what they perceived as 'Godlessness' in the society. The donations came mostly from Brazilian Catholics. The designs considered for the "Statue of the Christ" included a representation of the Christian cross, a statue of Jesus with a globe in his hands, and a pedestal symbolizing the world. The statue of Christ the Redeemer with open arms, a symbol of peace, was chosen.
In 1922, Landowski commissioned fellow Parisian Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida, who studied sculpture at the Fine Arts Conservatory in Bucharest and in Italy.
A group of engineers and technicians studied Landowski's submissions and felt building the structure of reinforced concrete (designed by Albert Caquot) instead of steel was more suitable for the cross-shaped statue. The concrete making up the base was supplied from Limhamn, Sweden. The outer layers are soapstone, chosen for its enduring qualities and ease of use. Construction took nine years, from 1922 to 1931 and cost the equivalent of US$250,000 (equivalent to $3,600,000 in 2019) and the monument opened on October 12, 1931.[5][6] During the opening ceremony, the statue was to be lit by a battery of floodlights turned on remotely by Italian shortwave radio inventor Guglielmo Marconi, stationed 9,200 kilometres (5,700 mi) away in Rome but because of bad weather, the lights were activated on-site.
In October 2006, on the 75th anniversary of the statue's completion, Archbishop of Rio, Cardinal Eusebio Oscar Scheid, consecrated a chapel, named after Brazil's patron saint—Our Lady of the Apparition, under the statue, allowing Catholics to hold baptisms and weddings there.

<h2> Construction </h2>
<hr>
At the origin of the project, there was the Brazilian State who wanted a monument to commemorate the centenary of Brazilian independence. A contest was launched, and Heitor da Silva Costa won. His sketch depicted a statue of Christ standing holding in his hand an earth globe and carrying a cross on his shoulders. On the basis of this drawing the site began on April 4, 1922, with the laying of the first stone ... but it was only a symbolic launch since the next two years were devoted to the improvement of the statue, structure and materials.
The real works began in 1926 but were rather slow. The builders worked on wooden models that were purposely built for the occasion, they were of various sizes depending on what to do. But this way of working was not satisfactory, and it was felt that the project would not come to an end by doing so.
Now that each task was assigned, the project was really launched. First of all, Paul Landowski modified the drawings of Oswald. He purified his head and hands in a more modern style for the time. Then he made the clay head, in real size, then a hand. This work, made in Paris, was sent by boat to Rio. Received on site by boat, the local work consisted of reproducing concrete models of clay, which took some time.

On the spot the work of the terrace was going well, and the base and its chapel were built. A steel frame was added to join the statue to the pedestal and the terrace, and then the concrete blocks representing the body of the statue were sunk. The molds were made locally on the basis of the various pieces sent by Paul Landowski, pieces of clay. Once poured, dried and then decoupled, the blocks were stacked to form the body, and then at the arms the structure was reinforced to support the weight of the arms. Finally, the head was installed.
The interior of the statue is a succession of 12 steps connected by rather steep staircases. The 10th stage is special because it is he who distributes the galleries inside the arms. At the top there is a trapdoor to go outside. The top of the head was equipped with lightning conductors. All that remained was to find the pavement, since raw concrete did not satisfy Da Silva Costa.
Da Silva Costa then went to Europe to meet the artists who had managed to make such statues. He surrounded himself with different people: the artist Carlos Oswald resumed the general form: Christ would be himself the cross, his outstretched arms signifying the redemption of mankind at the crucifixion. Such a statue required considerable effort, so traditional materials such as cast iron or copper could not be used. It was a new material that was chosen, something innovative: concrete. But nobody really knew how to dose it, how to use it. Silva Costa asked Albert Caquot, a French engineer, to take on the role of the designer of internal architecture. It is he who will make the concrete part, as well as all the calculations that go with it.

<h2> Facts about Christ the Redeemer </h2>
<hr>
1. Christ the Redeemer was built using reinforced concrete and has an outer shell of 6 million soapstone tiles. It’s believed that the workers who made these tiles occasionally wrote notes on the back, meaning this iconic landmark is full of hidden messages.

2. Due to the statue’s mountaintop position, it’s prone to lightning strikes and gets hit around three to six times a year. Prior to the FIFA World Cup in 2014, lightning struck and broke one of the statue’s thumbs.

3. The original design of the statue was different to what we see today. It was intended for Christ to be holding a globe in one hand and a cross in the other, rather than two open arms.

4. Christ the Redeemer was not actually built in Brazil. It was first made in France by French sculptor Paul Landowski who created the statue in clay pieces. These were then shipped to Brazil to be remade with reinforced concrete by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa and French engineer Albert Caquot.

5. Construction of the statue took 9 years. Beginning in 1922, it was finally finished in 1931 at a cost of $250,000 US.

6. The statue boasts an impressive title. In 2007 it was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World alongside top sights such as the Great Wall of China, Machu Picchu and the Rose City of Petra.

7. It’s one of the largest statues of Jesus and the tallest art deco statue in the world. Christ the Redeemer reaches a height of 30 metres and boasts an arm span of 28 metres.

8. Housing prices in Rio de Janeiro have increased simply if the property has a view of Christ the Redeemer. Apartments with even a slight view of the statue are higher than those with the same location and size but no view.


9. The light-coloured stone used to build the statue was taken from a quarry near the city of Ouro Preto. However, this stone is in short supply and restoration works are having to be done using different types. As a result, stone in a darker shade is slowly replacing the original, meaning Christ the Redeemer is gradually getting darker.

10. Each year, Christ the Redeemer is visited by nearly 2 million people. The record number of visitors to the statue in a single day was a huge 14,000 during Easter of 2011.

<h2> More about Christ the Redeemer </h2>

Christ the Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese, local dialect  is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by Polish-French sculptor Paul Landowski and built by the Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with the French engineer Albert Caquot. The face was created by the Romanian artist Gheorghe Leonida. The statue is 30 metres (98 ft) tall, not including its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal, and its arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide. By comparison, it is approximately two-thirds the height of the Statue of Liberty’s height from base to torch.

The statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long, 700 short tons), and is located at the peak of the 700-metre (2,300 ft) Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca Forest National Park overlooking the city of Rio. A symbol of Christianity across the world, the statue has also become a cultural icon of both Rio de Janeiro and Brazil, and is listed as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone, and was constructed between 1922 and 1931.
Architectural statuary is often symbolic, like the figures within the pediment of the New York Stock Exchange or the western pediment of the U.S. Supreme Court building. Statues are often used as an expression of belief or what is valued by a corporation or group of people. Statues have also been used to symbolize a person's life and work, such as the Lei Yixin-designed Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial in Washington, D.C. Sculpture can have multiple meanings, as it does with Christ the Redeemer — the sign of the cross is forever present on a mountaintop, the remembrance of a crucifixion, the reflection of God's light, the strong, loving, and forgiving human face of God, and the blessing of a community by an ever present deity. For Christians, the statue of Jesus Christ may be more than a symbol. The Christ the Redeemer statue announces to the world that Rio de Janeiro is a Christian city.
If architecture includes everything in the built environment, we look at the purpose of this statue as we would any other structure. Why is it here? Like other buildings, the placement on the site (its location) is an important aspect. The statue of Christ the Redeemer has become a symbolic protector of people. Like Jesus Christ, the statue protects the urban environment, like a roof over your head. Cristo Redentor is as important as any shelter. Christ the Redeemer provides protection for the soul.
